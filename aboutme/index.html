    <h2>Luis Aviles</h2>
    <p>My name is Luis Aviles, I am trom Venezuela, I am married and have 2 wondertul children.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church for 19 years, and my favorite food is Lasa√±a.</p>
    <p>I am dedicated to the repair of computer equipment and cell phones, but I want to turn my professional career
        around and that is why I am currently in this web
        fundamentals course. It is a wondefiul experience to be sharing with so many people from different cultures, and
        who probably want to become self-sutticient as I do.</p>
